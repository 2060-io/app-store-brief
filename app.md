## Brief

### Creatives we need

- App icon
- Previews
- Other Banner (google play only)
- App splash screen

### What we used for the app

Font: Euclid Circular A

2060.io brand colors:

#3EBDB6
#7678ED

See website [https://2060.io](https://2060.io)

For the App we are only using the #3EBDB6 green.

### Guidelines

The name of the brand is "2060", but brand name of the App will be "Hologram". Web site will be updated accordingly.

For that reason, you are free to use other colors for the creatives (icon, previews, other banners, app splash screen), the only requirement is that it must combine with the #3EBDB6 green at some point in the app. By seeing the attached screenshots, you will see that we are using very few colors.

App icon not necessarily must use the #3EBDB6 green. But other creatives (Previews, etc) must combine with app colors.

#### Main concepts of the app - for giving ideas for the icon:

- **Innovation**: Hologram is a chat app AND a verifiable credential wallet. Verifiable credential is a relatively new standardized concept which deals with issuance of credentials (such as ID card) to users, users can then present their verifiable credentials to a receptor (chatbot service, other user) and receptor can instantly verify the credential is authentic. No other messaging app is providing Verifiable Credential features.
- **Decentralized**: Hologram is working thanks to a decentralized network. No one controls the network. Network is open, anyone can provide a chatbot service to it, any user can scan a chatbot QR code and start to interact with it. Anyone can develop and provide another mobile app like Hologram, it will be compatible with Hologram (user will be able to interact between different apps). Protocol used for the network is open source.
- **Trustable**: Hologram aims providing trustable services. User will be able to clearly identify a service provider (company name, ...) before connecting to a service.
- **Self-custody**: No need to create an account in order to use Hologram. No need to verify a phone number, an email address... absolutely no data of the end user is collected.

#### Sources of inspiration

- **Hologram**: an hologram is a 3D image which is the result of interferences between several signals.
- **modernity, web3, innovation**: some time ago we designed a first concept for 2060.io. I put the related creatives in the "old" directory. These creatives have a great sense of modernity, web3, but these are not directly suitable for an app icon. Maybe the old/home-open.png, the old/integrate-dapps.png could be of interest. The old/operate-agency.png shows an hologram (in the cube) which is the result of the interferences of several signals. I like the glow effect of the old/home-open.png.


#### Examples

(taken from the old directory)


![Alt text](image.png)

here we can see signals that are entering the cube and creating an hologram inside

![Alt text](image-1.png)

a combination of the two could be an idea. I mean, a single transparent cube with glowing below, and some signals entering the cube and generating an hologram inside. but of course less detailed as icons does not give enough resolution for something very detailed.

Regarding the colors, we could do several attempts:
- One attempt by combining #3EBDB6 and #7678ED, which are the colors used in 2060.io
- One attempt by using colors of the first example above
- One attempt by using colors of the second example above

You can use any source of inspiration in the old directory.
